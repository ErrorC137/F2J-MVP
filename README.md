Free to Joy - XRPL Hackathon 2025

Overview  
Free to Joy revolutionizes social impact by tokenizing volunteered time as a tradable cryptocurrency on the XRPL blockchain. 
This project addresses the lack of transparent incentive systems for volunteerism, converting hours of community service into 
redeemable F2J tokens that can be exchanged for rewards, discounts, or privileges. By leveraging Web3 technology, we create a 
global ecosystem where altruism becomes measurable, tradable, and sustainable.

Features  
XRPL-Powered Tokenization  
Convert volunteered hours/donations into F2J tokens using XRPL's fast and low-cost transactions.  

Proof-of-Contribution Validation  
Decentralized validation of volunteer actions via photo proofs of contribution and organizational validation.  

Token Redemption Marketplace  
Burn tokens for rewards like tutoring sessions, meal vouchers, or partner discounts.  

Web3 Interface  
User-friendly dashboard for tracking contributions, token balances, redemption history.  

Real-Time Impact Tracking
All transactions are recorded immutably on the XRPL ledger for public transparency.  

DAO-Ready Architecture  
Built-in governance hooks for future dao integration.
